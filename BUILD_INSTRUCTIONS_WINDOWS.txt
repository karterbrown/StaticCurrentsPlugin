Static Currents Plugin - Windows Build Instructions
=====================================================

PREREQUISITES:
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 (Community Edition is free)
   - During installation, select "Desktop development with C++"
   - Make sure Windows 10/11 SDK is installed

2. (One-time) Ensure this project was generated by Projucer
   - The Visual Studio solution already exists in Builds\VisualStudio2022
   - If you ever need to re-generate it, use Projucer on macOS and re-copy
     the updated Builds\VisualStudio2022 folder to Windows

BUILDING THE STANDALONE APP (EXE ONLY):
1. Open "Builds\VisualStudio2022\Static Currents Plugin.sln" in Visual Studio

3. In Visual Studio, go to Build > Configuration Manager
   - Select "Release" for best performance (or "Debug" for testing)
   - Select "x64" architecture

4. In Solution Explorer, right-click the "Standalone Plugin" project
   - Select "Set as Startup Project"

5. Build just the standalone app
   - Right-click "Standalone Plugin" and select "Build"
   - Or use Build > Build Standalone Plugin

6. After a successful build, the EXE will be here:
   Builds\VisualStudio2022\x64\Release\Standalone Plugin\StaticCurrentsPlugin.exe

RUNNING THE APP:
- The EXE is portable and can run from anywhere
- If you want an installer, use an external installer tool (e.g., Inno Setup)

CREATING A WINDOWS INSTALLER (INNO SETUP):
1. Install Inno Setup from https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

2. Create a new file named "installer.iss" next to the EXE and paste this:
   (Update AppName/AppVersion/AppExeName if you rename the project)

   [Setup]
   AppName=Static Currents Plugin
   AppVersion=1.0.0
   DefaultDirName={pf}\Static Currents Plugin
   DefaultGroupName=Static Currents Plugin
   OutputDir=.
   OutputBaseFilename=StaticCurrentsPluginSetup
   Compression=lzma
   SolidCompression=yes

   [Files]
   Source: "StaticCurrentsPlugin.exe"; DestDir: "{app}"; Flags: ignoreversion

   [Icons]
   Name: "{group}\Static Currents Plugin"; Filename: "{app}\StaticCurrentsPlugin.exe"
   Name: "{commondesktop}\Static Currents Plugin"; Filename: "{app}\StaticCurrentsPlugin.exe"; Tasks: desktopicon

   [Tasks]
   Name: "desktopicon"; Description: "Create a &desktop icon"; GroupDescription: "Additional icons:"; Flags: unchecked

3. Build the installer
   - Right-click installer.iss and choose "Compile"
   - The output will be: StaticCurrentsPluginSetup.exe

4. If the installer runs on a machine without the MSVC runtime:
   - Install the "Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable" for VS 2022
   - Or bundle it using Inno Setup (optional)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If you get "cannot find JUCE modules" errors:
  1. Open MyFirstPlugin.jucer in the Projucer application
  2. Click the Visual Studio 2022 exporter
  3. Update the module paths to point to your JUCE installation
  4. Click "Save Project" to regenerate the Visual Studio solution

- Make sure all JUCE module paths point to: C:\JUCE\modules
  (or wherever you installed JUCE)

- If Visual Studio still builds plugin targets:
   1. Re-open the project in Projucer (on macOS)
   2. Confirm only "Standalone Application" is enabled
   3. Save the project, then re-copy Builds\VisualStudio2022 to Windows

FEATURES:
- Click any parameter slider to reset it to default
- FET-style compressor with soft-knee and harmonic saturation
- Gain, pitch, and playback controls
- Professional UI with centered labels
